<p class="ourImpactcaption">In this podcast, we hope to contribute to the shift in the narrative of refugees across the world and encourage stakeholders and listeners alike to take action. We do not want the label of refugee to define these individuals as powerless victims, instead, we intend to portray them as the determined individuals that they are with full agency to succeed in any way they desire, given the right resources.</p>

    The protracted refugee crisis in the Middle East, as well as further afield, has placed host governments under significant pressure to accommodate for the needs of individuals who have sought refuge in their countries. As financial pressures, shrinking economies and rising unemployment plague many refugee- hosting countries, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, the presence of large refugee populations has created an additional burden.

                Conflict in the Middle East has resulted not only in the loss of life but also in loss of livelihood for millions of refugees. The economic consequences of societies that have collapsed due to conflict have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has created an even more urgent need for alternative solutions for refugee resilience.

          With an increasing number of refugees fleeing from conflicts to neighbouring countries, as well as much further afield, host governments are struggling to deal with the changing situation on the ground. As financial pressures, shrinking economies and rising unemployment plague many refugee-hosting countries, the presence of large refugee populations has created an additional burden.

          Ministers from around the globe are gathering in Brussels for the “Supporting the future of Syria and the region” conference. They will discuss a political solution to the Syrian conflict and follow up on humanitarian pledges made previously. While indeed the focus should be on ending the protracted conflict, those present should also give serious attention to enhancing the economic independence of the many displaced people. In doing so, they should not shun innovative pathways.

        In December 2017, I published an article on the World Economic Forum titled “How remote work could help refugees”. At that time, remote work was niche, with many companies not believing that it could be possible for their employees, and certainly not for refugees.

      As the world transitions toward a post-COVID reality with many companies abandoning their corporate offices, encouraging their employees to work from home or anywhere, the workplace is being re-imagined. Now that companies realize that employees do not need to be in an office, an opportunity has opened for refugees who have the skills. Refugees can be hired remotely by global companies.

      Since Workplaceless first engaged in the mission of teaching remote skill development, a primary aspect of our vision has been to leverage remote work as a way to increase accessibility of employment opportunities for under-served areas and populations. As we set out to advance this goal, we were grateful to be connected with Lorraine Charles, Director and Co-founder of Na’amal, who shares a similar vision of remote work as a means to provide opportunities for refugees and other vulnerable populations.
